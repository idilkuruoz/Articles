I am İdil Kuruöz. A new graduate psychology student at Bilkent University. Here are some articles I have written for my significant courses throughout my university years. This repo includes:
1. An EEG article is a project proposal (proposed by me) about "Effects of EEG Neurofeedback Training on Visuospatial Working Memory Performance: A Comparison between Auditory Short-Term Deprived and Healthy Individuals."
2. A fMRI project report on the brain images taken from participants to investigate the brain activities to face and house conditions.
3. A real-life psychology experiment and its results about "The effect of romantic attachment style in romantic relationships on jealousy types and the difference in gender and relationship duration."
4. A deeper investigation on a specific topic (proposed by me) of cognitive science about "Is Cultural-Historical Activity Theory More Compatible with Interactivism than Vygotsky’s Original Work?"
5. A clinical psychopathology-based investigation about "The Role Of Genetic And Environmental Factors In The Development Of Schizophrenia."
6. A deeper investigation on a specific topic about non-human animal minds named " A Comparative Thanatology: An Exploration of Non-Human Animals Concept of Death."
7. My senior thesis on "Effect of Model's Age on Mate Choice Copying."
